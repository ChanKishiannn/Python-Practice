## 💡 Why I'm Doing This

I believe the best way to grow as a programmer is by **practicing consistently**, **building small projects**, and **reflecting on what I’ve learned**. This repository helps me:

- Stay consistent and organized
- Track my progress over time
- Revisit past concepts when needed
- Share my journey with others

Whether you're also learning or just passing by — welcome, and I hope something here inspires you!
